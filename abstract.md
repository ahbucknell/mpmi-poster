# Abstract
Phytopathogenic fungi significantly impact global food security, causing up to 40% of annual crop yield losses worldwide. 
Alone, the blast fungus _Magnaporthe oryzae_ has a global economic impact of $66 billion per annum. Phytopathogens deploy intracellular virulence proteins known as effectors 
that promote pathogenesis through interaction with host plant proteins. Resistance against phytopathogens can occur through recognition of these effectors by intracellular 
immune receptors known as NLRs. Some NLRs recognise effectors through direct interaction between effectors and integrated domains (IDs), which have been shown to be modular 
and can be swapped to change the effector recognition profile. The modularity of IDs has facilitated many attempts at engineering expanded effector recognition profiles to 
achieve novel disease resistance. However, this process is mostly limited to IDs where the effector-ID interface is already understood. Utilising _de novo_ protein design tools, 
we have generated effector-binding proteins (binders) against three _M. oryzae_ effectors: AVR-Pii, AVR-PikF, and APikL2. Here, we show that some of these binders interact with 
their cognate effector _in vitro_ and trigger immune responses in planta when integrated as an ID within an NLR. Our work advances previous efforts to broaden NLR recognition by 
allowing the design of novel effector-binding IDs based on protein structure alone.
